# ALU Design using Vivado

## 📌 Description
This project implements an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed and simulated using Vivado.  
The ALU performs basic arithmetic and logical operations based on control signals.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Vivado
- Digital Logic Design
- Hardware Description Concepts

## ✨ Features
- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, ect..)
- Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)
- Simulation and verification using Vivado

## 📚 What I Learned
- Digital circuit design
- ALU architecture
- Simulation and debugging in Vivado
- Understanding hardware-level operations
